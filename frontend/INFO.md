# How to develop in this repo?
- Make a new html file and name it (the page you are reprogramming).html
- Start programming using any language that won't require a server to display, as all of these webpages are static
- Make sure it works on all screen sizes
- Your program will be displayed in an iFrame so do not use general tags in your css (like body and html) because that will cause the rest of the webpage outside of the iFrame to be affected
- Use only unique class and ID names
